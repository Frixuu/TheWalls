==== 
Legacy

It was one of my main projects, rewritten at least 3 times.
It gave me some experience and wider look at possible code architectures.

This project uses self made APIs, to speed up "development". Since i stopped working on this projects. They become obsolete, especially because their quality is not great.

But hey, it worked and made profit which is the core of the success :)
